## Overview
Build on top of [Jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber), Jest-Cucumber-Fusion handle the writing of the corresponding Jest test steps using an uncluttered cucumber style.
Instead of using `describe` and `it` blocks, you instead write a Jest test for each scenario, and then define `Given`, `When`, and `Then` step definitions inside of your Jest tests. 
Jest-Cucumber-Fusion then allows you to link these Cucumber tests to your javascript Cucumber feature steps.
Adding a `Fusion`call, the links between your Feature definition and your Steps definition is handled automatically and the necessary scaffolding for jest-cucumber is build behind the scene.
Now use jest naturally in your project like you would use the native Cucumber library.

## Motivation

Jest-cucumber is an amazing project but forces you to write a lot of repetitive scaffolding code to setup the link betwen Jest and Cucumber.
With Jest-Cucumber-Fusion, it really takes only the minimal code possible:
 - a Cucumber Feature file with gherkin sentences
 - a Cucumber Step definition file with your javascript validation code, ended with the `Fusion` function to link the two



## Getting Started

### Install Jest Cucumber Fusion:

```
npm install jest-cucumber-fusion --save-dev
```

### Add a Feature file:

```gherkin
###filename: rocket-launching.feature
Feature: Rocket Launching

Scenario: Launching a SpaceX rocket
  Given I am Elon Musk attempting to launch a rocket into space
  When I launch the rocket
  Then the rocket should end up in space
  And the booster(s) should land back on the launch pad
  And nobody should doubt me ever again
```

### Add the following to your package.json configuration:

```javascript
"jest": { "testMatch": [ "**/*.steps.js" ] }
```


### Add a your Cucumber Step definition file and load Fusion
```javascript
//filename: rocket-launching.steps.js
const { Given, When, Then, And, But, Fusion } = require( 'jest-cucumber-fusion' )

```

### Load any dependency you need to do your test

```javascript
//filename: rocket-launching.steps.js
const { Given, When, Then, And, But, Fusion } = require( 'jest-cucumber-fusion' )

const { Rocket } = require( '../../src/rocket' )
let rocket

```

### Add steps definitions:

```javascript
//filename: rocket-launching.steps.js
const { Given, When, Then, And, But, Fusion } = require( 'jest-cucumber-fusion' )

const { Rocket } = require( '../../src/rocket' )
let rocket

Given( 'I am Elon Musk attempting to launch a rocket into space', () => {
    rocket = new Rocket()
} )

When( 'I launch the rocket', () => {
    rocket.launch()
} )

Then( 'the rocket should end up in space', () => {
    expect(rocket.isInSpace).toBe(true)
} )

And( /^the booster\(s\) should land back on the launch pad$/, () => {
    expect(rocket.boostersLanded).toBe(true)
} )

But( 'nobody should doubt me ever again', () => {
    expect('people').not.toBe('haters')
} )
```

### Adding the Fusion() call at the end of the Step definition file
You have to match it with your Cucumber Feature definition file:
```javascript
//filename: rocket-launching.steps.js
const { Given, When, Then, And, But, Fusion } = require( 'jest-cucumber-fusion' )

const { Rocket } = require( '../../src/rocket' )
let rocket

Given( 'I am Elon Musk attempting to launch a rocket into space', () => {
    rocket = new Rocket()
} )

When( 'I launch the rocket', () => {
    rocket.launch()
} )

Then( 'the rocket should end up in space', () => {
    expect(rocket.isInSpace).toBe(true)
} )

And( /^the booster\(s\) should land back on the launch pad$/, () => {
    expect(rocket.boostersLanded).toBe(true)
} )

But( 'nobody should doubt me ever again', () => {
    expect('people').not.toBe('haters')
} )


Fusion( 'rocket-launching.feature' )
```

## Adding coverage
Since we're using jest, it is very easy to generate the code coverage of your Cucumber test:
```javascript
"jest": {
    "testMatch": [
      "**/*.steps.js"
    ],
    "coveragePathIgnorePatterns": [
      "/node_modules/",
      "/test/"
    ],
    "coverageDirectory": "./coverage/",
    "collectCoverage": true
  }
```
